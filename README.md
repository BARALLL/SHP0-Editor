Blender Addon to create and manipulate shp0 files, used for polygon morphing and vertex displacement animations.
Reverse engineering process to understand the .shp0 file format from hex.


    roadmap:
        + is done
        * partially done
        - needs to be done

        Priorities:
            verify is animation data/entry correctly written to file
            section 1
            update offsets

        
        section 0:
            file header (just need length of file update with                                           +
            ftell() then fseek(0x04) once all the file is written)
            
            shp0 header                                                                                 +
        
            Animation Data
                use of shape keys for animation entries
                0x00 bitflags                                                                           +
                (but still need the update animation button, hopefully find a way to get rid of it)
                and better coord between vg size and animIndex (off by 1 when size vg -1)               *
                
                0x04/8? name offset to section one vg name                                              *
